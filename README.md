In the realm of common fears, individuals grapple with anxieties about phobias like flying, spiders, or predators. However, the statistical concern demanding attention lies in vehicle accidents, which are more detrimental to society. In Seattle, this reality takes form, with 2,500 severe injuries and fatalities recorded annually due to traffic incidents. This underscores the critical need to prioritize safety while navigating the city's intricate roadways.

Motivated by a commitment to local well-being, I conduct a thorough analysis of Seattle's accident data. As a resident, my goal is to contribute to initiatives that raise awareness among residents by identifying key circumstances. This involves a focus on accident occurrences and the rates of fatalities and serious injuries. Each data point enhances the narrative of road safety in our vibrant community, aligning with collective efforts to understand accident-prone conditions and utilizing data to inform and heighten awareness.

## The Data

The dataset provides comprehensive data on vehicle accidents in Seattle from 2003 to 2023, incorporating over 240,000 records.

## Data Analysis

The data was analyzed using SQL. It includes detailed information on weather, road conditions, fatalities, injuries, and related factors, with temporal insights spanning yearly, monthly, and hourly intervals.

## Key Takeaways

Key takeaways emphasize that accidents are influenced by a variety of contributing factors, including:

### Yearly and Monthly Trends

- There has been a gradual decline in overall accidents; however, there has been an increase in overall accident-related deaths over recent years.
- The safest months to drive are February, March, and June when it comes to the lowest fatality rates and the number of accidents.

### Weather Condition

- Accidents that took place on clear weather days occurred nearly double the amount of times in comparison to rainy and overcast accidents combined.
- Accidents under dry weather conditions had a deadlier fatality rate (0.23% of accidents) and serious injury rate (1.82%) in comparison to overcast/rainy conditions.

### Road Surface

- The highest fatality rates occurred when the road conditions were actually dry, contrary to popular belief.

### Daylight vs Dark

- The fatality rate of accidents when conditions were dark (0.37%) was well over double in contrast to the daytime (0.16%).

### Type of Accident

- The most common types of accidents include hitting parked cars, colliding at angles, and rear-end incidents.
- The most dangerous types are colliding with pedestrians and cyclists, as well as head-on collisions.

### DUI & Speeding

- DUI-related accidents were five times more deadly (1.07%) than when not under the influence (0.168%).
- Speeding was also found to be seven times more deadly (1.05%) than not (0.15%).

## Conclusion

Based on the examination of the dataset, we can infer that:

- Over the past few years, overall accidents have decreased, but fatalities are on an upward trajectory.
- Clear weather conditions account for 65.5% of deaths, exhibiting a higher fatality rate than rainy and overcast conditions.
- Dry road conditions contribute to 78% of deaths, displaying a higher fatality rate compared to adverse road conditions.
- Despite approximately 70% of accidents occurring in daylight, accidents in dark conditions are over two times more fatal.
- The most common types of accidents include hitting parked cars, collisions at angles, and rear-end incidents.
- DUIs and speeding significantly elevate the risk of death in accidents, with severe implications for safety.
